3. Using Python for task 3.
	a. The dates are in INTEGER dtype and cannot be used. I believe all of the dates columns behave like this.
	b. Certain columns contain dictionary, which require the values to be split.
		1. i.e. the rewardsReceiptItemList column in the receipt table have dictionaries with as many as 15 keys
	c. There are nulls in the tables ( So watch out when your parsing it )
	d. There are a lot of missing data aside from Nulls such as 'ITEM NOT FOUND'
	e. In the receipt table, the total spent column can have nulls or the amount 0
